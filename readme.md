# Lean 4 - Logic

Lean 4 code to follow-along with [A Concise Introduction to Mathematical Logic][1].
Remarks, examples, lemmas, and theorems are mostly reproduced, and files in the
repository follow their chapter and section number.

Additionally, I may want to have a portion of this repo explicitly _not_ follow the
book, but instead take the learnings from formalizing and produce a sensible logic
package.

## Status
Currently formalizing chapter 1 section 4.
